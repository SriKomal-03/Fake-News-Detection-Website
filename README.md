🔍 Fake News Detection Website

I developed a comprehensive website that predicts whether a news article is genuine or fake, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and seamless web development practices. This project combines technology, design, and problem-solving to combat misinformation effectively.

🌐 Frontend Development:
Designed and implemented a highly responsive and visually appealing user interface with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website includes four key pages:

🏠 Homepage: Outlines the purpose and functionality of the project.
📰 Prediction Page: Provides a user-friendly form where users can input news articles for real-time analysis.
ℹ️ About Us Page: Describes the project goals, methodology, and contributors.
📞 Contact Us Page: Allows users to reach out for inquiries or feedback.
🧠 Machine Learning Backend:

Built a robust ML model in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
Utilized TfidfVectorizer to process text data, converting it into numerical representations for the model.
Implemented the PassiveAggressiveClassifier for accurate and efficient fake news detection, offering quick and reliable results.
🔗 Full-Stack Integration:

Seamlessly connected the frontend with the backend using Flask, enabling smooth communication and real-time predictions.
Ensured the system is robust and scalable for future enhancements.
